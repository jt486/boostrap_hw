<h2>The 2019 Dodge Charger</h2>

<p class="text-justify">The Charger can compete with pony cars at the drag strip and with full-size sedans on family
    road trips, offering a
    combination of machismo and functionality at an affordable price that is uncommon for its class. The Dodge is also
    the only option in this segment with rear-wheel drive and a raucous set of V-8 engines. The standard V-6 shares a
    superb eight-speed automatic transmission with its V-8 brethren, but only it has all-wheel drive as an option.
    Compared with near-luxury rivals, the Charger is rough around the edges; its fantastic infotainment system is
    unfortunately surrounded by an interior clad in plastic. Its eye-popping exterior colors and decals recall icons of
    the past but bring the Charger up short in contrast with its more refined competitors. Nevertheless, the result is
    an affordable muscle machine for the whole family. </p>

<p class="text-justify">Dodge has a penchant for keeping its aging products desirable by adding new features and
    equipment each model year.
    For 2019, the Charger receives updated interior options such as houndstooth cloth seats and stitched leather
    surfaces. The lineup has also been streamlined with fewer models, which now includes a rear-drive GT version (the
    entry-level SXT now offers all-wheel drive). It and the Charger R/T add upgraded exterior details pulled from the
    707-hp Hellcat model. This means a more aggressive front end, bulging hood, sculpted side skirts, and optional
    20-inch wheels. Both models now come standard with a sport-tuned suspension and revised steering—among other chassis
    enhancements. The top-of-the-line R/T Scat Pack has new exterior badging, a refreshed grille design with dual air
    inlets, and newly optional adaptive dampers. Likewise, every Scat Pack now has a system called "Launch Assist" that
    optimizes traction during take-offs and a line-lock feature that allows smoky burnouts to heat up and clean the rear
    tires for maximum acceleration runs. </p>

<p class="text-justify">The Charger is a big, heavy car with a healthy appetite for fuel. Although it has below-average EPA estimates in the
    city, it has fairly competitive highway ratings. We haven't tested the V-6 version or the 485-hp V-8 on our highway
    fuel-economy loop, but the 5.7-liter V-8 engine exceeded its 25-mpg estimate by 1 mpg. </p>
